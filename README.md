### Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to apply the knowledge and skills gained during the Data Analysis training. The focus will be on understanding, processing, and analyzing datasets to draw meaningful insights. This analysis will enable organisations to make data-driven decisions ultimately enhancing employee satisfaction, retention and business outcomes. By the end of the project, I aim to have  developed the proficiency in using data analysis tools, interprete data and present findings effectively.

### Data Sources

The dataset for analysis will be selected from open-source platforms provided as part of the course. I will ensure that the data is relevant to the problem statement and is well suited for analysis.

### Tools Used

Throughout the training, I will be using the following tools and software.

- Microsoft Excel
  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Analysis and
  3. Data Visualisation
- SQL- Structured Query Language for Querying of Data
- Github for portfolio building

  ### Data Cleaning and Preparations

- In the initial phase of the training, we performed the following actions;
  1. Data loading and inspection
  2. Handling missing variables
  3. Data cleaning and formatting
  4. Data validation
 
  ### Exploratory Data Analysis

  EDA involved the analyzing of datasets to summarize their main characteristics such as;
    - Understanding the patterns
    - Trends
    - And relationship through Statistical Methods and Visualisation.
 
  ### Data Analysis

  This is where we include some basic lines of functions, code, queries. Functions like;
    - SUMIF
    - AVERAGE
    - FIND FUNCTION
    - VLOOKUP
    - TEXT FUNCCTION e.t.c

      Queries like;

      SELECT * from EMPLOYEE
      WHERE FIRSTNAME = 'FEMI'

  ### Data Visualization

  This is presenting our results using charts, graphs and other visualisation tools.

  ### Learning Outcome

  By the end of this training, I expect to:

  - Develop a strong understanding of data manipulation and analysis techniques
  - Improve my ability to interprete data-driven insights.
  - Gain hands-on experience with industry standard data analysis tools.
  - Build a foundamental data skill set that will be useful in the long run.
